                         vMOTION 

• VMware VMotion enables the live migration of running virtual machines from one physical server to
another with zero downtime, continuous service availability, and complete transaction integrity.

VMotion is a key enabling technology for creating the dynamic, automated, and self optimizing data center.
Benefits of vMotion

• Continuously and automatically allocate virtual machines within resource pools.
• Improve availability by conducting maintenance without disrupting business operations.


                            How is VMware VMotion Used?
VMotion allows users to:

• Automatically optimise and allocate entire pools of resources for maximum hardware utilisation,
flexibility and availability.

• Perform hardware mamtenance without scheduled downtime.

• Proactively migrate virtual machines away from failing or underperforming servers.

                            Howe does vMotion works?

• VMotion manages the virtual MAC address as part of the process. Once the destination machine is
activated, VMotion pings the network router to ensure that it is aware of the new physical location of the
virtual MAC address. Since the migration of a virtual machine with VMotion preserves the precise
execution state, the network identity, and the active network connections, the result is zero downtime and
no disruption to users.

                            Key features of vMotion

• Reliability: Proven by thousands of customers in production environments since 2004, VMotion
continues to set the standard for the most dependable live migration capabilities.

• Performance: Perform live migrations with downtime unnoticeable to the end-users. Optimal use of CPU
and network resources ensures that the live migrations occur quickly and efficiently.

• Interoperability: Migrate virtual machines running any operating system across any type of hardware and
storage supported by VMware ESX Server.

» Support for Fibre Channel SAN-: Implement live migration of virtual machines utilising a wide range
of up to 4GB Fibre Channel SAN storage systems.
