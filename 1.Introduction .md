                                               what is virtualization?
Virtulization is a process by which we abstract physical resources & make it Virtual

Difference between virtualization and Cloud
• Virtualization
Virtualization is technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or
dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system. Software called a hypervisor
connects directly to that hardware and allows you to split 1 system into separate, distinct,
and secure environments.

• Cloud
Cloud is a set of principles and approaches to deliver compute, network, and storage
infrastructure resources, services, platforms, and applications to users on-demand 
across any network. 

There are two types of hypervisors

• Type-I
Native or bare-metal hypervisors:-These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to
control the hardware and to manage guest operatmg systems. For this reason, 
they are sometimescalled bare metal hypervisors

• Type-2
Hosted hypervisors These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system (OS) just as
other computer programs do. A guest operating system runs as a process on the host.

Type-2 hypervisors abstract guest operating systems from the host operating system. VMware
Workstation, VMware Player, VirtualBox , Parallels Desktop for Mac and QEMU are examples
of type-2 hypervisors

                                              VMware vSphere Components and Features

• VMware vSphere includes the following components and features.

• VMware ESXi
A virtualization layer run on physical servers that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and resources into multiple
virtual machines.

VMware vCenter Server
• The central point for configuring, provisioning, and managing virtualized IT environments. It provides essential
datacenter services such as access control, performance monitoring, and alarm management.

• VMware vSphere Client
An interface that enables users to connect remotely to vCenter Server or ESXi from any Windows PC.

• VMware vSphere Web Client
A Web interface that enables users to connect remotely to vCenter Server from a variety of Web browsers and
operating systems.

VMware vSphereSDKs
Feature that provides standard interfaces for VMware and third-party solutions to access VMware vSphere.

vSphere Virtual Machine File System (VMFS)
A high performance cluster file system for ESXi virtual machines.

Sphere Virtual Machine File System (VMFS)
high performance cluster file system for ESXi virtual machines.

vSphere Virtual Machine File System (VMFS)
A high performance cluster file system for ESXi virtual machines.

vSphere Virtual SMP
Enables a single virtual machine to use multiple physical processors simultaneously.

vSphere vMotion // IMP
Enables the migration of powered-onvirtual machines from one physical server to another with zero down
time, continuous service availability, and complete transaction integrity Migration with vMotion cannot
be used to move virtual machines from one datacenterto another.

                                        vMOTION

vSphere Storage vMotion
Enables the migration of virtual machine files from one datastore to another without service Interruption.
You can place the virtual machine and all its disks in a single location, or select separate locations for 
the virtual machine configuration file and each virtual disk. The virtual machine remains on the same host
during Storage vMotion.

Migration with Storage vMotion lets you move the virtual disks or configuration file ofa virtual machine
to a new datastore while the virtual machine is running. Migration with Storage vMotion enables you to
move a virtual machine's storage without any interruption in the availability of the virtual machine.  

                                 vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)
Allocates and balances computing capacity dynamically across collections of hardware resources for
virtual machines. This feature includes distributed power management (DPM) capabilities that enable a
datacenter to significantly reduce its power consumption.

vSphere Storage DRS
Allocates and balances storage capacity and VO dynamically across collections of datastores. This feature
includes management capabilities that minimize the risk of running out of space and the risk of 1/0
bottlenecks slowing the performance of virtual machines.

vSphere Fault Tolerance
Provides continuous availability by protecting a virtual machine with a copy. When this feature is enabled
for a virtual machine, a secondary copy of the original, or pnmary, virtual machine is created. All actions
completed on the primary virtual machine are also applied to the secondaryvirtual machine. If the primary
virtual machine becomes unavailable, the secondary machine becomes Immediately active.

                                       vCenter Server /// IMP
 
• vCenter Server provides a single point of control to the data center. It provides essential data center
services such as access control, performance monitormg, and configuration. It unifies the resources
from the individual computmg servers to be shared among virtual machines in the entire data centen It
manages the assignment of virtual machines to the ESXi hosts and the assignment of resources to the
virtual machines within a given computing server. These assignments are based on the policies that the
system administrator sets.

Compute servers continue to function even if vCenter Server becomes unreachable (for example, if the
network is severed). The ESXi hosts can be managed separately and continue to run the virtual
machines assigned to them based on the resource assignment that was last set. After connection
to vCenter Server is restored, it can manage the data center as a whole again.


                                       vSphere Software Components

• VMware vSphere is a suite of software components for virtualization. These
include ESXi, vCenter Server, and other software components that fulfill several different
fimctions In the vSphere environment.

• vSphere Includes the following software components.

ESXi
• The hypervisor runs virtual machines. Each virtual machine has a set of configuration and disk
files that together perform all the åmctions of a physical machine.

• Through ESXi, you run the virtual machines, install operating systems, run applications, and
configure the virtual machines. Configuration includes identifying the virtual machine's resources,
such as storage devices.

• The server provides bootstrapping, management, and other services thatmanage your virtual
machines.

                                             vCenter Server
• A service that acts as a central administrator for VMware ESXi hosts that are connectedon a
network. vCenter Server directs actions on the virtual machines and the ESXi hosts.

• vCenter Server is a single Windows or Linux Service and is installed to run automatically.
The vCenter Server service runs continuously in the background. It performs its monitoring and
managing activities even when no vSphere Clients are connected and when no one is logged on to
the computer where it resides. It must have network access to all the hosts it manages.

• You can install vCenter Server on a Windows virtual machine or physical server, or deploy
the vCenter Server Appliance. The vCenter Server Appliance is a preconfigured Linux-based
virtual machine optimized for running vCenter Server and the vCenter Server components. You can
deploy the vCenter Server Appliance on ESXi hosts 5.5 or later, or on vCenter Server Instances 5.5
or later.
