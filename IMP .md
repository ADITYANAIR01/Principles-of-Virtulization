            VmWare Vsphere // imp
    
VMware vSphere is a powerful virtualization platform that transforms physical servers into pools of shared resources 
like CPU, storage, and networking. These resources can then be dynamically allocated to virtual machines (VMs) as
needed, allowing you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical server.
    
* key components of vSphere:

1. ESXI

2. vCenter server

3. vMotion

* Benefits of using vSphere:

Increased server utilization: Run multiple VMs on a single physical server, maximizing hardware resources.

Improved agility and flexibility: Quickly provision and deploy new VMs to meet changing business needs.

Enhanced disaster recovery: vMotion and other features help ensure business continuity in case of server failures.

Reduced costs: Consolidate hardware and software, lower energy consumption, and simplify IT management.


1.          ESXi:

Core of vSphere: ESXi is a bare-metal hypervisor that installs directly on physical hardware to run and manage VMs. 
It acts as the thin layer between the hardware and the VMs, providing virtualization capabilities and resource allocation.

Features:

* Virtualization core: Provides the foundation for running multiple VMs on a single physical server.

* Resource allocation: Allocate CPU, RAM, storage, and network resources to individual VMs.

* Security isolation: Ensures VMs are isolated from each other and the underlying hardware.

* High availability: Supports features like clustering and fault tolerance for increased uptime.


2.          VCenter:

Centralized management platform: Provides a single interface to manage all your ESXi hosts, VMs, and virtual resources. 

Features:

* Inventory and monitoring: Track resource utilization, performance, and health of VMs and hosts.

* Provisioning and deployment: Create and deploy VMs quickly and easily. 

* Security and access control: Manage user access and permissions for various virtual resources.

* Automation and scheduling: Automate common tasks like backups, VM migrations, and resource allocation.   

Center Server acts as the nerve center for managing and controlling all aspects of your vSphere infrastructure 
from a single console.

This includes:

* ESXi hosts

* Virtual machines

* Storage

* Networking

* Users and permissions

* Security policie 


3.            vMotion:

Live migration technology: Enables seamless migration of running VMs between physical hosts without downtime.

Benefits:

* Minimize downtime: Avoid service disruptions during hardware maintenance or upgrades.

* Load balancing: Shift VMs to underutilized hosts for better resource management.

* Disaster recovery: Quickly move VMs to backup servers in case of primary server failure.
