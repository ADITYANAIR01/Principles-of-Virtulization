                    Fault Tolerance

vSphere Fault Tolerance safeguards any virtual machine (with up to four virtual CPUs), including
homegrown and custom applications that traditional high-availability products cannot protect. Key
capabilities include the following:

• Compatible with all types of shared storage, including Fibre Channel, Internet Small Computer Systems
Interface (iSCSI), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Network-attached Storage (NAS).

• Compatible with all operating systems supported by vSphere.

• Works with existing VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler and VMware vSphere High
Availability (HA) clusters for advanced load balancing and optimised initial placement of virtual
machines.

• Contains a version-control mechanism that allows primary and secondary virtual machines to run on
vSphere FT-compatible hosts at different, but compatible, patch levels.   

                  vSphere Replication

• VMware vSphere Replication is an extension to VMware vCenter Server that provides hypervisor-based
virtual machine replication and recovery.

• vSphere Replication replaces storage-based replication. It protects virtual machines from partial or
complete site failures by replicating the virtual machines from a primary site to a secondary site.
vSphere Replication provides several benefits as compared to storage-based replication.

• Data protection at a lower cost per virtual machine.

• A replication solution that allows flexibility in storage vendor selection at the primary and secondary
sites.

• Overall lower cost per replication.           

• With vSphere Replication, you can replicate virtual machines from a primary datacenter to a secondary
site quickly and efficiently. After you set up the replication infrastructure, you can choose the virtual
machines to be replicated at a different Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

• You can configure all vSphere Replication features in the vSphere Web Client. You monitor the status of
replication through the replication management and monitoring dashboard.
