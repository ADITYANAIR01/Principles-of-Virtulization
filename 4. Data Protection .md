                        vSphere Data Protection

• vSphere Data Protection is a backup and recovery solution designed for vSphere environments. Powered by EMC Avamar,
it provides agentless, image-level virtual-machine backups to disk. It also provides application-aware 
protection for business-critical Microsoft applications (such as Exchange, SQL Server and SharePoint)
along with WAN-efficient, encrypted backup data replication.

• vSphere Data Protection is fully integrated with vCenter Server and vSphere Web Client.

• vSphere Data Protection can be deployed to Virtual Machine File System (VMFS), Network File System
(NFS) and Virtual SAN datastores. Management of vSphere Data Protection is done using the vSphere
Web Client. vSphere Data Protection is deployed as a virtual appliance with four processors (vCPUs) and
at least 4GB of memory depending on the backup data capacity of the appliance.
