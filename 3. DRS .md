                            Distributed Resource Scheduler

• VMware DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) is a utility that balances computing workloads with
available resources in a virtualised environment. The utility is part of a virtualisation suite called VMware Infrastructure 3.

• With VMware DRS, users define the rules for the allocation of physical resources among virtual machines (VMs).
The utility can be configured for manual or automatic control. VMware resource pools can be easily added, removed or reorganised. If desired, resource pools can be isolated between different business units. If the workload on one or more virtual machines drastically changes, VMware DRS redistributes the virtual machines among the physical servers. If the overall workload decreases, some of the physical servers can be temporarily powered-down and the workload consolidated.

                                 DRS Functionality

• VMware DRS runs within the VMware vCenter Server to automatically balance the memory load on all
virtual machines within a cluster. DRS intelligently allocates resources and can be configured to
automatically take care of workload migration (with VMotion) or assign migrations based on rules
defined by an administrator.

• Using resource pools that combine multiple host resources into one, DRS enables optimal workload
distribution on virtual machines based on business needs and changing priorities. DRS migrates VMS
based on the availability and utilization of CPU and memory resources.         

                                Distributed Power Management (DPM)

• DPM is a DRS "extension" that helps to save power (so we can be "green"). It recommends powering off
or on ESX hosts when either CPU or memory resource utilisation decreases or Increases. VMware DPM
also takes into consideration VMware HA settings or user-specifies constraints.

• It means that, if our HA tolerates one host failure, DPM will leave at least two ESXi host powered on.

                                How does DPM contact with ESXi host?

It uses wake-on-LAN (WOL) packets or these out-of-band
methods: Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) or HP Integrated Lights-Out (iLO)
technology. When DPM powers offESXi host, that host is marked as Standby (standby mode).
